# End-to-End Data Engineering
The Jabar Digital Service (JDS) oversees all data related to West Java Province. One of the datasets they manage is Coronavirus data, which is available to the public through an API. This project aims to :

1. Develop and design a complete data engineering solution using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services
2. Create a data pipeline that transforms raw data into meaningful insights
3. Visualize the data to meaningful insight

These insights will help inform decision-making and accelerating situation recovery and handling during the pandemic.
